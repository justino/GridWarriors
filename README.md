WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE FINISHED

This is a shitty "clone" of an old Intellivison game I loved.

Features:
- Terrible graphics
- Awful gameplay
- Locked not-mobile-friendly UI

## UI

Red Square - You
All other squares - Enemies

Flat disc - Deadly
Rectangle disc - Passive

## How to play

This is a keyboard based game.
A S D F to move Tran around the game grid.
Number pad: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9: are the disc throwing directions
Number pad: 5: blocks (not functional yet)

## Gameplay

The disc is your weapon. Throw them around the board and hit your enemies to kill them.

Use your control keys to move Tran around the board. Throw your deadly disc at enemies using the number pad.
Recall your disc by pressing the number pad keys again.

DEREZ EVERYTHING THAT MOVES

## Enemies

Warrior: normal speed, bad disc accuracy, kill with one hit
Bulldog: slow speed, better accuracy, kill with 2 hits, regenerates
Leader: fast speed, best accuracy
Guard: (not in game yet)
