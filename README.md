# TRAN

WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE FINISHED

This is a shitty "clone" of an old Intellivison game I loved.

Features:
* Terrible graphics
* Awful gameplay

**NOTE** This game will **not** play on Mobile devices, it requires a keyboard to play.

## UI

* Red Square - You
* All other squares - Enemies
* Flat disc - Deadly
* Rectangle disc - Passive

## How to play

This is a keyboard based game.

### Movement Keys

* `w`: Up
* `s`: Down
* `a`: Left
* `d`: Right

You can move diagonally with combinations of the keys.

### Disc throwing

You should use the number pad to throw your disc. You could use the numbers above the letters, but it would make for a bad time.

* `8`: North
* `2`: South
* `6`: East
* `4`: West
* `7`: North West
* `9`: North East
* `1`: South West
* `3`: South East

### Blocking (not yet functional)

* `5`: Block

### Pausing

You can pause the game.
While the game is paused, the game grid will be blanked out so you can't see where you or your enemies are located.

To pause the game:

* `p`: Pause

## Gameplay

Your disc is your weapon. Throw it around the board and hit your enemies to kill them.

Watch out though, your enemies have discs too!

Use your control keys to move Tran around the board. Throw your deadly disc at enemies using the number pad.

Recall your disc by pressing the number pad keys again.

DEREZ EVERYTHING THAT MOVES

## Enemies

* Warrior: normal speed, bad disc accuracy, kill with one hit
* Bulldog: slow speed, better accuracy, kill with 2 hits, regenerates
* Leader: fast speed, best accuracy
* Guard: (not in game yet)
